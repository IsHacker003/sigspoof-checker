# Signature Spoofing Checker

This Android app tests the signature spoofing capability of your OS as required by
the [microG Project](https://microg.org/). The app attempts to fake its own signature
and reports whether it succeeds. Simply launch the app to see the result of the test.
You can find more information about signature spoofing
[here](https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing).

This is a forked version updated to use the new `signingInfo` function and supports newer android versions.
